### ArtOS Version History
| Version  | Relase Date |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1.0 Antelope Canyon | Later this year |
| 1.1 Majorque | End of 2022 / 2023 |

## ArtOS 1.1 Majorque : Why ?
I started the development of the next version: CloOS Majorca (1.1), because Antelope Canyon (1.0) had serious problems in the kernel and in its development kit. ArtOS has also changed its name from ArtOS to CloOS.
Version 1.1 Majorca will contain all the features of Antelope Canyon plus new features such as Dynamic Wall, which allows looping videos to be displayed as wallpaper.
I released an unfinished version of ArtOS 1.0 later in the year, this one will not receive an update, the OS will contain unfinished or buggy features.
